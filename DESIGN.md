# sweetgreen — Style Reference

> farm-stand chalkboard at golden hour

**Theme:** light

Sweetgreen's design system is a warm, farm-stand-meets-modern-typography aesthetic: a cream canvas (#f4f3e7) rooted in natural materials, with deep forest green as the structural anchor and electric lime (#e6ff55) as a singular, high-energy action color. Photography carries the brand — saturated, overhead food shots on warm tile, ceramic, and concrete surfaces are treated as heroes, never as decoration. Typography does the heavy lifting on chrome: a custom geometric sans (SweetSans) renders oversized category labels and hero headlines at extreme weights (400 at 70–80px, with 0.85 line-height that lets letters nearly touch), while a secondary ultra-light display face (Grenette at 200) creates contrast through restraint. Components are deliberately spare — pill-shaped buttons, ghost text links with arrows, badge-free product cards — letting the food and the headline typography own every screen.

| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deep Forest   | `#00473c` | Primary brand color, nav logo, dark pill buttons, text accents, badge borders, link colors — the structural green that anchors the palette             |
| Lime Glow     | `#e6ff55` | Green action color for filled buttons, selected navigation states, and focused conversion moments.                                                     |
| Sage Mist     | `#d8e5d6` | Section backgrounds, card surfaces, content band alternation — soft botanical green that signals freshness without competing with the food photography |
| Warm Sand     | `#e8dcc6` | Accent surface for alternate section bands — warm beige that pairs with food photography and adds earthy variety to the green-dominant palette         |
| Cream Canvas  | `#f4f3e7` | Primary page background, the warm off-white that gives the entire system its organic, non-clinical feel                                                |
| Forest Shadow | `#0e150e` | Primary text color, borders, input strokes — near-black with a barely-perceptible green undertone that harmonizes with the brand greens                |
| Pure Ink      | `#000000` | Maximum-contrast text, hairlines, icon strokes — used where absolute sharpness is needed                                                               |
| Warm Gray     | `#8c8c82` | Medium-contrast borders, control outlines, and structural separators. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color                                       |
| Slate Gray    | `#555555` | Secondary text in disabled or low-emphasis button contexts                                                                                             |

## Typography

### SweetSans — Display headlines, hero text, large category labels — used at extreme sizes (70–80px) with tight leading (0.85) that lets letterforms nearly touch; weight 400 at this size is the signature choice, creating a calm authority that doesn't shout

- **Weights:** 400
- **Sizes:** 40px, 70px, 80px

- **Weights:** 200
- **Sizes:** 48px
- **Line height:** 1.00
- **Letter spacing:** -0.047em

- **Substitute:** Söhne, Inter, or GT America as a geometric grotesque alternative
- **Weights:** 400, 700

- **Substitute:** Söhne, Inter
- **Weights:** 400
- **Sizes:** 12px, 14px
- **Line height:** 1.29–1.33
- **Letter spacing:** 0.017em

## Components

### Pill CTA Button (Lime Fill)

**Role:** Primary action button — used for 'Order Now', 'Add to Bag', and any conversion action

Fully rounded (9999px) pill shape, #e6ff55 background, #0e150 text in SweetSansText weight 700 at 16–18px with 0.017em tracking, padding 16px 24px. The lime fill against the cream canvas creates the highest-contrast functional element on any page.

### Pill Outline Button (Forest Border)

**Role:** Secondary or navigation action — used for nav 'ORDER' pill, secondary CTAs

Fully rounded (9999px) pill, transparent or cream fill, 2px #00473c border, #00473c text in SweetSansText weight 700 at 16px, padding 12px 20px. Outlined rather than filled to maintain a lighter visual weight than the primary CTA.

### Ghost Text Link

**Role:** Inline action link — used for 'Order now →' on product cards, footer links, inline CTAs

No background, no border, #0e150 text in SweetSansText weight 700 at 16px, right-arrow glyph appended. Underline on hover only. The arrow is the visual anchor.

### Navigation Bar

**Role:** Top-level site navigation — persistent across all pages

Horizontal bar on #f4f3e7 background, centered logo 'sweetgreen' in #00473c at 24–28px SweetSansText weight 700, nav items flanking in SweetSansText weight 700 at 14px with 0.05em tracking, all-caps. Right-side 'ORDER' item rendered as a Pill Outline Button in #00473c.

### Menu Category Tab

**Role:** Section filter for menu browsing — 'Salads', 'Warm Bowls', 'Sides'

Large text-only tab, no border, no background change between states. Active tab: #0e150 in SweetSans at 40px weight 400 with a small dot indicator beneath. Inactive: #0e150 at 40px with no indicator. The typographic scale itself is the navigation signal.

### Product Card

**Role:** Menu item display — one card per food item in the browsing grid

Top: square food photograph with 20px border-radius. Below image: 24px padding, product name in SweetSansText weight 700 at 20px #0e150, 8px gap, description in SweetSansText weight 400 at 16px #0e150 with 1.25 line-height, 16px gap, 'Order now →' Ghost Text Link. No card background, no border, no shadow — the photograph IS the card surface.

### Online Only Badge

**Role:** Availability indicator on exclusive digital products

Absolute-positioned top-left of product card, #e6ff55 background, #0e150 text in SweetSansText weight 700 at 12px all-caps with 0.05em tracking, padding 4px 12px, 20px border-radius. Small, bright, unmissable.

### Full-Bleed Hero with Text Overlay

**Role:** Landing page hero — single product or campaign feature

Full-viewport-width photograph (no border-radius) as the background layer. Semi-transparent text overlay panel in cream (#f4f3e7 at ~90% opacity) anchored bottom-left, 40px padding, containing: small-caps eyebrow text in SweetSansText weight 700 at 14px, 8px gap, product name in SweetSans at 70–80px weight 400 line-height 0.85, 24px gap, Pill CTA Button (Lime Fill).

### Split Content Section

**Role:** Feature/editorial content — catering, about, mission sections

Two-column layout on a Sage Mist or Warm Sand section background. Left column: text stack with large display headline in SweetSans at 48–70px weight 400, 24px gap, structured sub-sections with bolded labels in SweetSansText weight 700 at 18px and body text in weight 400 at 16px. Right column: single full-bleed photograph with 20px border-radius. Generous 80–120px vertical padding.

### Eyebrow Label

**Role:** Pre-headline context label — 'SUNSHINE IN A SALAD', section identifiers

All-caps, SweetSansText weight 700 at 14px, 0.05em tracking, #0e150 or #00473c. Positioned 16–24px above the headline it qualifies. Functions as a typographic subtitle that adds context without visual weight.

### Food Photograph (Standard)

**Role:** Product and editorial photography

Overhead or 3/4 angle shots, high saturation, warm natural lighting. Rounded corners at 20px. No overlays, no text burned in. Full-bleed within their container — the food is the entire visual.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Use SweetSans at 70–80px weight 400 with 0.85 line-height for all primary display headlines — the weight-to-size ratio is the brand voice
- Default to #f4f3e7 as the page background; use #d8e5d6 or #e8dcc6 for alternating full-width content bands only
- Use #e6ff55 fill + #0e150 text exclusively for the primary action button — never invert the relationship
- Render all buttons as fully rounded pills (9999px radius) with 16px 24px padding and SweetSansText weight 700 at 16px
- Let food photography fill its container edge-to-edge with 20px border-radius — no frames, no borders, no overlays around images
- Use 'Order now →' as a Ghost Text Link (no background, arrow glyph) for all secondary product actions
- Apply positive letter-spacing (0.01–0.05em) to all text below 24px in SweetSansText for legibility

### Don't

- Don't use multiple accent colors — the palette is intentionally restricted to one lime (#e6ff55) and one forest green (#00473c) for action and brand respectively
- Don't set headlines in weight 700 or above — the brand's authority comes from the calm confidence of 400 at large sizes
- Don't add card backgrounds, borders, or drop shadows to product cards — the photograph is the card
- Don't use the lime (#e6ff55) for anything other than primary CTA fills and availability badges
- Don't use line-height above 1.0 for display type — the tight leading is what makes the headlines feel monumental
- Don't render buttons as rectangles, capsules, or with subtle radii — pill (9999px) is the only button shape
- Don't apply gradients — the system is entirely flat color, with warmth coming from the cream canvas and saturated photography

## Elevation

- **Product cards, CTA buttons:** `rgba(14, 21, 14, 0.4) 3px 3px 32px -10px`

## Surfaces

- **Cream Canvas** (`#f4f3e7`) — Base page background — warm off-white that reads as organic rather than clinical
- **Sage Mist Band** (`#d8e5d6`) — Full-width content sections alternating with the canvas — calm botanical background for text-forward or split-layout content
- **Warm Sand Band** (`#e8dcc6`) — Alternate section background — earthy warm tone for visual rhythm variation
- **Lime Glow Highlight** (`#e6ff55`) — Accent surface for badges and CTA fills — the only chromatic surface that draws functional attention
- **Deep Forest Surface** (`#00473c`) — Dark accent surface for nav pills, dark-mode content blocks, or reversed text sections

## Imagery

Photography is the primary visual content. All images are high-saturation, overhead or 3/4-angle food photography shot in warm natural light, presented on organic surfaces (ceramic tile, concrete, wood, linen). Treatments are full-bleed within containers with consistent 20px border-radius — no frames, no borders, no decorative overlays. No illustrations, no abstract graphics, no 3D renders, no stock lifestyle photography. The food IS the visual content. Icons are minimal — line-based, single-weight strokes in #0e150, used only for functional UI (arrows, close, back). The 'ONLINE ONLY' badge is the only UI element that overlays photography directly.

## Layout

Full-bleed hero photography with bottom-left text overlay panel on the landing page. Max-width 1200px centered for all content sections. Section rhythm alternates between #f4f3e7 canvas and full-width #d8e5d6 or #e8dcc6 bands with 80–120px vertical padding. Menu grid uses a 3-column card layout with square product photographs. Editorial content sections use a 2-column split (text left, single full-bleed photograph right). Navigation is a single top bar — no sidebar, no mega-menu, no sticky behavior beyond the nav itself. Generous whitespace between sections creates a calm, gallery-like pacing where the food and typography can breathe.
